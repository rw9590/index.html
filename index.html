<pr>Cubism was an artistic style pioneered by Picasso and his friend and fellow painter Georges Braque.Why is Picasso important? For nearly 80 of his 91 years, Picasso devoted himself to an artistic production that contributed significantly to the whole development of modern art in the 20th century, notably through the invention of Cubism (with the artist Georges Braque) about 1907</pr>
<pr>Van Gogh was known for his thick application of paint on canvas, called impasto. An Italian word for “paste” or “mixture”, impasto is used to describe a painting technique where paint (usually oil) is laid on so thickly that the texture of brush strokes or palette knife are clearly visible. </pr>  </head>
